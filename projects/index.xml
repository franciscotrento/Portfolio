      <description>The Specters of Svalbard. We will produce a procedural film dealing with materialities that surround Svalbard’s Seed Bank, its tensions with climate change and its potential for fabulatory storytelling through event-led film-making. At least two two-week trips to the surroundings of Svalbard’s Seed Vault in Longyearbyen will be organized. There are conceptual resonances between the concepts of seedbank and seed vault and the fabulatory stories that circulate in Svalbard. That is why we do not propose the use of a traditional script.</description>
