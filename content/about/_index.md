Hello. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Concordia University, Montreal. I participate in the Senselab - a laboratory for thought in motion - since 2015. My research interests range from research-creation, film studies, spectrality, radical pedagogy, and neurodiversity. Recently I translated books and articles by Erin Manning, Brian Massumi, and David Dunkel. I have a Ph.D. in Communications and Semiotics from Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo (PUC-SP). In my <a href="https://www.academia.edu/35477925/Espelhos_negros_mutac_o_es_do_desejo_e_da_cri_tica_na_comunicac_a_o" target="_blank"> Ph.D. thesis </a>, analyzing the Tv-Series 'Black Mirror', I discussed the possibility of creating an immanent critique of media, based on Spinoza's distinction between ethical evaluation and moral judgment.   Recently, I have been focusing on the production of multimodal research-creation propositions (artistic research), that have been gestated in the form of texts, video and coding platforms.
