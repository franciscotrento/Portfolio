spctrz expresses the tension between necessity and contingency, exploring do-it-yourself improvised rituals to invoke specters. Specters, as Derrida exposes, are neither creatures from the past or from the future. They are disjointers of time. We explored different media: from found-footage of VHS tapes to collected old notes. Techniques to invoke the ghosts of neurodiversity are necessary to disrupt the chronological neurotypical time or task-oriented daily lives.
