The Specters of Svalbard. We will produce a procedural film dealing with materialities that surround Svalbard’s Seed Bank, its tensions with climate change and its potential for fabulatory storytelling through event-led film-making. At least two two-week trips to the surroundings of Svalbard’s Seed Vault in Longyearbyen will be organized. There are conceptual resonances between the concepts of seedbank and seed vault and the fabulatory stories that circulate in Svalbard. That is why we do not propose the use of a traditional script. The enabling constraints (seeds) are a condition for the success of the project. Constraints are elements that differentiate improvisation from fabulation. An anarchival film does not rely on the idea of a form (formalism) but seeks to build or restore fabulatory forgotten cartographies, inspired by artists like Deborah Stratman, especially her film The Illinois Parables (2016). The research aims to fabulate how the concept of process seed bank being developed at Senselab and its anarchival procedures resonate with Svalbard’s Global Seed Vault and the alarming scenario of climate change affecting the islands. We see Svalbard’s Seed Vault as a media archive according to the Derridean concept, containing traces of potentiality (seeds). Some techniques to activate them are needed. For the archive to live and activate its potentiality, it needs to be anarchived. In 2017, due to the permafrost melting, the access tunnels to Svalbard Seed Vault flooded. Fake news about seeds damaged have been disseminated, a fact that was later denied. However, which elements, textures, and tonalities can be anarchived and fuel fabulation way past Svalbard’s actual fear of the end of this world and the rumors around its purpose? The archive of Svalbard Seed Bank is not made only of seeds and concrete. It resonates the world itself as an archive populated with ghosts of environmental changes in the future. The melting of the ice sheets brings back spectral qualities of other times. We aim to deal with its materiality: what sounds and textures does this ice-melting platform deploy? 

## Walks (Is it future or is it past?)
 Walks around Svalbard will be organized around the Seed Vault located in Longyearbyen. The walk will be activated by seeds brought from Senselab’s Process Seed Bank (materials, performance practices; etc.), discussing lost past cartographies circulating around Svalbard’s Seed Vault, as what new narratives and techniques of anarchiving can be constituted around the affects it feeds: fear, hope, despair, and its textures– no plant seeds will be brought to avoid ecological interference and imbalance. Who is going to participate on the walks? We will look for collaborations with artistic and academic institutes in Svalbard (as UNIS; University of Svalbard and Artica Svalbard) that can publicize our invitations to walk that shall be also extended for any person who happens to be there at the time. Although, it is important to underline that, as Erin Manning developed on Always More than One (2012), neurodiversity implies recognizing the multiplicity of ways of decentering the Cartesian subject that perceives oneself as a single entity that carries a straight definition of one’s self. The walks are always relational and non-hierarchically distributed event (between the artist, environment, fauna, flora, film equipment, the deep past of the permafrost, etc.) 
Filming will use digital and analog devices. The walks are not touristic but seek to dialogue with minor elements that may have been forgotten or misfiled, producing a critical engagement with the environment. Springgay and Truman (2018) argue that the practice of walking, if thought purely as an isolated technique of escape, is grounded in a privileged point of the view of the white heteronormative able individual who can walk freely detached by the streets not worrying as if the elements that one can relate with could be deliberately chosen. This technique needs to be brought back to neurodiverse life and its non-recognized modes of walking that are inherently anarchival. As Butler (2018, p. 30) says, “Svalbard is a land of traces: what dies, lingers. The bone beds of the whaling stations, the outposts with their ragged timbers overlooking the straits. Each thing that lives its space on the island casts some small shadow; a sundial arm of birth and death”. 

## Anarchival Editing
 The footage captured in Svalbard will be brought back to the lab, where it will be edited and anarchived. The whole material will be cut into fragments. Footage captured with analog devices will be digitized to make it more accessible for anyone interested in collaborative editing. The fragments are called seeds of futurity and can be recombined at the research center or in an online platform that will allow anybody to create its iteration of The Specters of Svalbard. The idea is that iterations themselves do not possess any hierarchical status: i.e.: an iteration of the film that may be screened at a film festival does not express better the quality of The Specters of Svalbard that any of them created online, perennial or stored in the users’ devices. Ideally, the first screening of The Specters of Svalbard would coincide with the release of the online collaborative editing platform, for it can give publicity, making the project’s dissemination more successful. While the development of such a platform, due to its complexity, can take time and efforts that may extrapolate our expenses and schedule plan, there are some works available online as modifiable open-source frameworks and JavaScript libraries that can be the starting point for the interface. I emphasize moviemasher.js and angular-moviemasher , a combination between a JavaScript library and an Angular (front-end web development framework) that constitutes an online-video editor interface and API. 
Usually, this kind of video editing platform that allows actions by multiple users at the same time, if necessary, demands servers with at high processing power and large bandwidths. One possible solution to detour high expenses is to use the university’s servers. While adapting the code to match our conceptual and aesthetic interests may take a while, the editing work in the lab may start as soon as the first trip to Svalbard ends and the material arrives in the research center.
