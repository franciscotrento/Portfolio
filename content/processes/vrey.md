After meeting in Montréal, two creatures wanted to keep meeting and writing from the germ that was activated last summer. Kathy Acker and McKenzie Wark’s _I’m Very Into You_ fabulated into _I’m Vrey Into You_. _Vrey_, as said after one returns from the Red Room in Twin Peaks, where words have another temporality. This resonated with our bodies in different chronological times zones while still living in a spectropoetic togetherness. Soon we couldn’t stop working in vrey, and now, 7 weeks after saying _“See you soon!“_ there are already 100 pages. Writing together, loosing both our -and finding many more-than - voices made us think about non-typicality, creating conditions, and anarchival techniques which will hopefully attune to conversations of a future-past.
